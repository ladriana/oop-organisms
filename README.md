## OOP - Research Lab
Acme Inc., a British Biology research lab needs a _`new software system`_ which allows them to classify the organisms that they are studying.
 
1.  Please identify a few organism types and describe their characteristics and behaviours. 
2. Then, observe the relationships between. 
3. Create a class hierarchy which expresses that classification. 
4. Use the __*OOP concepts and principles (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)*__ to express your types.

Through good design you'll end up reusing functionality from parent types in child types.
For each type you modelled implement the common methods we learned about: getters & setters for instance variables, toString() and equals().

_Create a program which collects a set of organisms (objects) in an array_. Iterate over that array and call *method(s) describing common functionality*. Observe which method implementation is called on each object at runtime.

Work using `Maven` and `Git`. Submit your solution as a link to your `GitHub` repository.
